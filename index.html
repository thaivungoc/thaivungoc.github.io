      <h3>Great for our group</h3>
      <p1>We use MediaFire to share the sheet music and audio practice files for our chorus. 
        I can practice along to audio in the car using the mobile app, print the sheet music from my desktop, etc. 
        Easy to use & very helpful to our group.</p1>

        <h3>Great app!</h3>
        <p1>I like this service a lot since I work in TV and Film and use it for sending low res effects shots or just collaborating with friends or coworkers. I invested and purchased one of their offered plans but the free one is great too. 
          I say run don't walk and go have fun with this whether business or just your own convenience!</p1>
