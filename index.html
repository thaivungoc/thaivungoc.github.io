      <h3>Great for our group</h3>
      <p1>We use MediaFire to share the sheet music and audio practice files for our chorus. 
        I can practice along to audio in the car using the mobile app, print the sheet music from my desktop, etc. 
        Easy to use & very helpful to our group.</p1>

      <h3>One of my favorite apps!</h3>
      <p1>Perfect for storing all files in the cloud. 
        I've used this daily for past year and absolutely love it. Great for saving audio recordings, documents, photos, videos, etc. 
        I'm very happy to have found MediaFire. Thank you, it has really helped me time and again.</p1>

        <h3>Great app!</h3>
        <p1>I like this service a lot since I work in TV and Film and use it for sending low res effects shots or just collaborating with friends or coworkers. I invested and purchased one of their offered plans but the free one is great too. 
          I say run don't walk and go have fun with this whether business or just your own convenience!</p1>
